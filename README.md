# sumsets
Powered by Python and itertools, leveraging the `combinations` function.

## Scenario
You're a small business owner trying to reconcile some expenses. Let's say this mystery expense needs to add up to $1,234.56. No problem. Import your transactions (CSV) and tell sumsets you need it to return a value that adds up to $1,234.56. Let the combinations algorithm to the heavy lifting. It will find all possible combinations of expenses that added up to $1,234.56. Your "needle in a haystack" problem just got a lot easier.
